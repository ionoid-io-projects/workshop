# Installing Raspbian on the Raspberry Pi : A Simple guide. (Linux GUI users)

[see Windows users version](https://github.com/opendevices/iot.apps/blob/master/doc/od-iot-raspbian-rpi-zero-windows.md)

[see MacOS users version](https://github.com/opendevices/iot.apps/blob/master/doc/)

This guide will show you step by step, a straightforward process how to install a Raspbian OS  on
Raspberry Pi 2. This method also work for all the different models of Raspberry Pi (A, B, B+, 2)


To succeed this installation , we need some equipment and software.

Equipment :

 - MicroSD card (at least 8 Gb).
 - Ethernet Cord.
 - MicroSD card reader , if your computer doesnâ€™t have a SD card slot.
 - Power supply (2.5 A) with micro USB cable.

Optional equipment :
 - USB keyboard.
 - USB mouse.

Software:
 - Raspbian image .
 - Etcher software.

The process is very simple, download a Raspbian image and Etcher software,
use Etcher to write the Raspbian image into the SD card  and boot.


## 1. Downloading Raspbian.

  - Download the Raspbian image ,  you can find the latest version here [Raspbian Image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) .

## 2. Copy Raspbian  to SD card.

The easiest way to flash (copy) Raspbian image to the SD card is using  Etcher software. It works on
all platforms (GNU/Linux, Mac and Windows).

  - Download Etcher , here [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) , choose the appropriate  version , in our case Linux-x64 version.

![download etcher linux](https://github.com/opendevices/iot.apps/blob/master/doc/img/EtcherDownload.png)

  - Unzip it
  - Insert the SD card into the SD Card reader.
  - Run Etcher

  - Once Etcher open , browse and select the Raspbian image.
  - Select the SD card that you which install Raspbian on.

  - Click on the flash button.

Once it's finished  Etcher unmount automatically the SD card   , you can  remove it safely  from the computer
SD card reader.

## 3. Configure Wifi and enable ssh service.
It's practical to configure WiFi network and enable ssh service during the installation,
that way the Raspberry Pi connect automatically to your network while boot
and you can connect to it using ssh from your computer.
Other wise you have to plug USB keyboard, mouse and HDMI screen to the Raspberry Pi and configure it

So to configure WiFi network and enable ssh during installation do the following :
 - Reinsert the MicroSD card into your computer (a boot and rootfs partitions will appear).
 - Open a text editor for exemple **gedit**.
 - Copy / paste the following WiFi configuration and adapt it to your network (change SSID and PSK).

 ```bash
 country=AU
 ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
 update_config=1
       network={
         ssid="SSID"
         psk="PASSWORD"
         key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
       }
 ```
 - save it with the name **wpa_supplicant.conf** under boot partition of MicroSD card.
 - to enable ssh , open new file with gedit , let it empty and save it with **ssh** name under the same boot partition.

## 4. Boot your Raspberry Pi

Now our Raspberry is able to boot

![image plug ]()

- Insert the SD card into Raspberry Pi SD card slot.
- Power with Micro USB cable (a least 2.5 A).
- Plug the USB keyboard and mouse.
- Plug your screen  HDMI cord .

 enjoy  ;)
