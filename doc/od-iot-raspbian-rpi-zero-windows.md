  ![Boot auto](https://github.com/opendevices/iot.apps/blob/master/doc/img/BootPartWindows.png)

  - open **notepad** and copy/paste the following lines

```bash
	country=AU
	ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
	update_config=1
        network={
	        ssid="SSID"
	        psk="PASSWORD"
	        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
        }
```

 - Replace **SSID** with your Wifi ID and **PASSWORD** with your Wifi password.
 - Save the file as **wpa_supplicant.conf** under **boot** partition.


or if you can put the MicroSD Card on Linux, you will have the
**rootfs** partition then save it as **wpa_supplicant.conf** under **rootfs** partition under **/etc/wpa_supplicant/**
